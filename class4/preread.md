**Pre-Reading Material: Understanding CSS Box Model, Display Property, and Positioning**

Welcome to the fascinating realm of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)! In this pre-reading material, we will explore three essential concepts in CSS—Box Model, Display Property, and Positioning. These concepts are foundational for crafting well-organized and visually appealing web pages.

### CSS Box Model:

#### What is the Box Model?

The CSS Box Model is a crucial concept that defines how elements on a webpage are structured and how space is allocated around them. It conceptualizes every HTML element as a box and helps us understand how these boxes are sized, spaced, and interact with each other.

#### Components of the Box Model:

1. **Content:** The actual content of the box, such as text, images, or other media.

2. **Padding:** The space between the content and the border. It controls the element's internal spacing.

3. **Border:** Surrounds the padding and content, defining the outer boundary of the box.

4. **Margin:** The space outside the border, determining the clearance between the element's border and surrounding elements.

#### Box Model in Action:

Understanding how the Box Model works is vital for designing layouts and managing spacing effectively. It plays a crucial role in creating visually appealing and responsive web pages.

### CSS Display Property:

#### What is the Display Property?

The CSS `display` property defines how an element should be displayed on the webpage. It plays a significant role in determining the layout and rendering of elements.

#### Common Values of Display Property:

1. **block:** Renders the element as a block-level container, occupying the full width available and stacking vertically.

2. **inline:** Renders the element as an inline-level container, allowing other elements to sit beside it in the same line.

3. **inline-block:** Combines features of both `block` and `inline`, allowing the element to flow inline while also respecting height and width properties.

4. **flex:** Enables a flex container, allowing easy alignment and distribution of space among items in a container.

5. **grid:** Enables a grid container, providing a two-dimensional layout for items.

Understanding the `display` property is essential for creating flexible and responsive designs.


#### 4. Different CSS Units:
   - **Absolute Units:**
     - `px` (pixels)

   - **Relative Units:**
     - `rem` (relative to the font-size of the root element)
     - `%` (percentage of the parent element)
     - `vw` (viewport width)
     - `vh` (viewport height)
