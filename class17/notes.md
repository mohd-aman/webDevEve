 Introduction to JSON 

---

### JSON

JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. It is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is based on the JavaScript programming language, but it is language-independent, meaning it can be used with many programming languages, including Python, Ruby, PHP, and many others. Let's break this down into simpler concepts:

### 1. What is JSON?

Imagine you're writing down your shopping list in a way that you want both your friends and a computer to understand. You would choose a simple, structured format, right? JSON is exactly that but for data. It uses a set of rules to represent data as text, making it easy to send this data across the internet or save it in files.

### 2. Structure of JSON

JSON's format is reminiscent of JavaScript object literal syntax, but with some restrictions. It mainly consists of two structures:

- **Objects**: These are collections of key/value pairs. In JSON, an object begins with `{` (left brace) and ends with `}` (right brace). Each key is followed by a colon (`:`) and then the value assigned to that key. Key-value pairs are separated by commas. For example:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "isEmployed": true
  }
  ```

- **Arrays**: These are ordered lists of values. In JSON, an array begins with `[` (left bracket) and ends with `]` (right bracket). Values are separated by commas. For example:

  ```json
  ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
  ```

Values in JSON can be strings (text wrapped in double quotes `" "`), numbers, objects, arrays, `true`, `false`, or `null`.

### 3. How JSON Works with JavaScript

Now , the major application of this JSON format is to pass data from one System to another , As Most of the internet's data transmission protocols, like HTTP, are text-based. They are designed to transmit data as text rather than in proprietary formats (objects or arrays). JSON, being a text-based format, fits seamlessly into this architecture.

So Now as JSON is text(string) based so to transfer data from one system another we need to convert data that we need to transfer into JSON string

We will take a very fun example for this

Imagine you have a box of toys. In the world of web development, your toys are your data, like names, ages, or places. Now, you want to send this box to a friend who lives far away. But there's a catch: you can't send the box as it is; you need to pack it in a special way so that it can travel through the internet. This is where **JSON** comes into play.

**JSON** is a way to pack your data (toys) so that they can travel easily over the internet. It turns your data into a string (a sequence of letters, numbers, and symbols) that can be sent and then unpacked by your friend (or another computer).

Let's create a simple example to illustrate both parsing and stringifying with toys as our data. First, we'll "pack" our toy data into a JSON string using `JSON.stringify()`, and then we'll "unpack" it using `JSON.parse()`.

```javascript
// Define our toys as a JavaScript object
var toys = {
  toy1: {name: "Teddy Bear", color: "Brown"},
  toy2: {name: "Race Car", color: "Red"},
  toy3: {name: "Doll", color: "Pink"}
};
// Now Here this is in  Javascript object Format and in this format data cannot be sent over the internet as this is not universally understood by the data transfer protocols

// Pack our toys into a box (convert our toys object into a JSON string)
var toysJSONString = JSON.stringify(toys);
console.log("Packed Toys:", toysJSONString);


// Here We have converted the javascript object into JSON string now this is understood by the protocolos

// Now, let's say this JSON string is sent over the internet.
// On the other side, we receive this packed box of toys as a JSON string.


// Now as we are recieving a JSON string , so while writing javascript code we will not be able to apply object properties in a JSON string , so now to convert the string again to object we will parse it


// Unpack our toys from the box (parse the JSON string back into a JavaScript object)
var unpackedToys = JSON.parse(toysJSONString);
console.log("Unpacked Toys:", unpackedToys);

// Now, 'unpackedToys' is a JavaScript object with our toys,
// and we can access and work with them like before.
console.log("Let's play with the:", unpackedToys.toy1.name); // Accessing the Teddy Bear
```

In this example:
- We start with our toys organized in a JavaScript object.
- We "pack" these toys using `JSON.stringify()`, turning them into a string that can be easily sent over the internet.
- We simulate receiving this packed string on the other side and then "unpack" it using `JSON.parse()`, turning it back into a JavaScript object that we can work with.
- Finally, we access one of the toys from our unpacked object to show that it's back to its original, usable form.


### 4. Why Use JSON?

JSON is popular for several reasons:

- It is text, and can be read and written by humans.
- It is easy for machines to parse and generate.
- It is fully compatible with JavaScript and many other languages, making it a good choice for data interchange on the web.

In summary, JSON is a universally accepted format for structuring data, making it an essential part of modern web development. Its simplicity, ease of use, and compatibility with many programming languages have made it a preferred choice for data interchange on the internet.

 Introduction to API 
---

### API and the Use of JSON Data

After understanding the basics of JSON and its importance in web development, it's crucial to explore how JSON data is utilized in APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). APIs play a pivotal role in enabling different software applications to communicate with each other. They act as intermediaries that allow applications to exchange data and functionality easily and securely. JSON, with its simplicity and efficiency, is widely used as the format for exchanging data in API communications. Let's delve deeper into APIs and the role of JSON data in this context.

#### What is an API?

An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to access the data or functionality of another application, server, or service. APIs are like menus in a restaurant; the menu provides a list of dishes you can order, along with a description of each dish. When you specify which dish you want, the kitchen (the system) prepares the dish and serves it. In the digital world, APIs work similarly: they allow developers to request specific data or actions, and the system responds accordingly.

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/049/289/original/upload_53dd165cb742742e9f97796f9941eaf0.png?1695148884)

#### The Role of JSON in APIs

JSON is the medium through which data is exchanged between clients and servers in many APIs. It serves as the "language" that both the requesting and the responding parties understand. Here's how JSON is used in the context of APIs:

1. **Requesting Data**: When an application requests data from a server, it sends an API call, which is essentially a request made over the internet. This request often includes data formatted as a JSON string. For example, an application might request the details of a user by sending a JSON string that specifies the user ID.

2. **Responding to Requests**: Upon receiving the request, the server processes it and sends back a response. This response is typically also in JSON format, containing the data requested or confirmation of the action taken. For instance, a server might respond with a JSON object that includes the user's details.

3. **Ease of Integration**: The reason JSON is so popular in API development is its ease of integration with most programming languages. Libraries in Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and many others can easily parse JSON strings into native data structures of the respective language (like dictionaries in Python or objects in JavaScript) and vice versa.

4. **API Endpoints**: APIs are structured around endpoints, each serving a specific function. An endpoint for retrieving user data might return a JSON object with user attributes, while another endpoint for posting user data might accept JSON-formatted user details.


Overall an API is just an interface which will allow two systems to communicate with each other with each other and the format it uses is JSON , there are other formats as well and ways as well lie SOAP architecture is there which uses XML  simlarly what we are are learning falls under REST where we use JSON as mode of communication ,more on REST Architecture later...

So Now , Imagine we want to create a  weather application the features of the application should be- 

- It will have a search bar where you can enter any cities name an their will be a button to get it's weather Info.

- As soon as you click on the button you should be served with that cities weather Information in a decent looking card

These properties should be shown compulsarily- 
  - City Name
  - Temparature
  - Condition (hot , humid , cold , Rainy etc)
  - current date and time in the city

  Rest you can add any other property that you want to show!

So , This is a very simple app , we just need data for this , and how we are going to get the data? 

Exactly an API!

Now What can be the steps to get the data from an API?
Suppos there is a weather API which has data about the weather conditions of diffrent places , how should we communicate with that and get exact data that we are looking for?

**Steps to get the data from an API -**

1. The application sends a request to the weather API's endpoint, possibly including the location's coordinates in a JSON-formatted request body.
2. The weather API processes this request and responds with a JSON object containing weather details like temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
3. The application then parses this JSON response and uses the data to display the weather information to the user.




**Let's create this application then!!**


> Show some examples of APIs to the students , You can just google JSON API and go to images , there will be so mnay omages that will represent data in JSON format

Tell them that we will be creating a weather app today and open it. (Show the DEMO of the APP)

**To start creating this app we need access to API from where we are going to get the data**

For our app we will be using the API from here -
> https://www.weatherapi.com/
> Inform that they need to sign-in.

* Find the API key and paste it under the **API explorer** tab. 
* Select the protocol as **HTTPS**.
* Click on show response. You can see the JSON format in the response section.



> https://www.weatherapi.com/.do. 

* After logging in, there will be an API key generated which will be unique for everyone. Copy that key first.
* Under **API Response Fields**, you can check all the fields that the API is providing. There are many options available. 
* Under **API Explorer**, paste the key. You will see the API Call as follows.

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/049/292/original/upload_b1ce9393b8bd6d8ad8c11d66a121acac.png?1695149012)


Here the "q" stands for **query** and here we are querying for London. The call is basically our URL and inside this we also have our API key and the search query. 

* Apart from the current data, you can also get the Forecast, Future data as provided by the API. 

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/049/293/original/upload_04a31b2878e550d5e6bf91f446d29778.png?1695149064)

So Now that you know what API we are using and how on querying for  a specific city we are getting weather data for for that city in JSON format , Now let's put this data into use to create an application!

> Inform the students that For this project, we will be focusing on the JS part, so the CSS part has already been created and we just have to paste it. 
> Guide the students about the final interface before starting the code. 

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/049/294/original/upload_29da4001046dbfb1550deb5c6acdfa5b.png?1695149088)


**Step 1**
Create `index.html`, `style.css` and `index.js` files in VSCode. 

**Step 2**
Inside the `index.html` file, we will be creating various divisions for various parameters like temperature, location, time and date etc. 

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/049/295/original/upload_a9c73804d050f6a0f077c520dcb3203b.png?1695149109)

In the other division for weather condition, we will display an emoji along with the weather condition. 

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/049/296/original/upload_89a96e16ee00ec649a4e80c5b3f90cc8.png?1695149128)

**Step 3**
Create a form which contains an input field and a button also. 

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/049/297/original/upload_7ba43e5dbf022aa0a217332ecc9afad7.png?1695149155)

> Write a step-by-step code for each step. 

**Code**
```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang = "en">
<head>
    <meta charset = "UTF - 8">
    <meta http-equiv = "X - UA - Compatible" content = "IE = edge">

<body>

     <div class = "container">
         <div class = "weather">
             <div class = "temp">20</div>
             <div class = "time_location">
                 <p>Location</p>
                 <span>Random time and Date</span>
             </div>

             <div class = "weather_condition">
                  <p><img src = "" alt = ""></p>
                  <span>Condition</span>
             </div>
         </div>
     </div>


     <nav>
         <form>
             <input type = "text" placeholder = "Search_location" class = "searchField">
             <button type = "submit">Search</button>
         </form>
     </nav>


</body>

<script src = "index.js"></script>
</html>
```

Execute the above code, the output is

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/049/298/original/upload_d0356ec9757a7bebdf0714ff51d749dd.png?1695149252)

This is a simple HTML code, we will have to add CSS to style it.


**Style.css**-
```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Economica&family=Grape+Nuts&family=Roboto:wght@100;300;400;700;900&display=swap");

* {
  margin: 0%;
  padding: 0;
  font-family: "Roboto", sans-serif;
}

.container {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  background-color:#01161E;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}


.weather {
  z-index: 2;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  color: white;
}

.weather > div {
  margin: 0.625rem;
}

.weather1 {
  font-size: 4rem;
}

.weather p {
  font-size: 2rem;
}
.weather span {
  font-size: 0.75rem;
}

.weather3 span {
  margin: 0.3rem;
}

.weather3 img {
  width: 2rem;
}
nav {
  height: 100px;
  padding: 1rem 0;
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0%;
  width: 100%;
  background-color: rgba(180, 177, 177, 0.202);
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

nav form {
  width: 70%;
  grid-template-columns: 5fr 1fr;
  display: grid;
}

.searchField {
  font-size: 1.1rem;
  outline: none;
  color: white;
  background-color: transparent;
  padding: 1rem 0;
  border: none;
  border-bottom: 2px solid white;
  width: 98%;
}

nav form button {
  background-color:#4ECDC4;
  font-size: 1.1rem;
  color: white;
  outline: none;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;}
```

After executing the CSS code, the output is

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/049/299/original/upload_f0509cd60bb58737e5373d70d48b4648.png?1695149282)

**Index.js**-

We will see how to get data from an API. We will use the **fetch API**. The **fetch()** method will be used here.
> Type fetch method in the browser and just show the docs as a glimpse. 

The API URL will be passed to the fetch() method as a parameter. We will understand how to use the fetch() method inside our JS code.


The try block is used to execute the code that might encounter an error. An error can lead to unexpected termination of the program. Hence we put it inside the try block and any error that might be encountered by the try block is sent to the catch block.

In the try block, we will define the URL which is the API call. 

```javascript
 let url = `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=35af7ff606db422880d141328231305&q=${target}&aqi=no`
 ```
Here we have wrapped the url in backticks so that we can use the string template literals which denoted bt the `${}` symbol.


Now as API in an external data source so the program may take some time to get the data from there , and whenever there are some heavy time consuming operation what do we use?

Exactly! Asynchronous Programming!

Here we will just use an Async Function which will be responsile for getting data from the API and to get the data from an API we use the fetch method 



**Key points**
* In APIs, we will be using the asynchronous JS. 
* We will be using **async** and **await** keywords which are important to work asychronously
* The **async** keyword needs to be added before the function which tells the function that it is asynchronous. 
* The **await** keyword tells that it needs wait till the data comes and the promise resolves

```javascript
const response = await fetch(url)
```

Now let's run the code till now. 

```java
let target = "Pune"
async function fetchData(target){
    try {
        let url = `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=8b6d5f63a04a485fa5351525232908&q=${target}&aqi=no`

        const response = await fetch(url)

        console.log(response)
    }
    catch(error){
        console.log(error)
    }
}

fetchData(target)
```

We will obtain this

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/049/300/original/upload_f06df9d4a4683805954bb656a39fe8f5.png?1695149320)

Here we are fetching a JSON file across the network. The simplest use of fetch() takes one argument — the path to the resource you want to fetch — and does not directly return the JSON response body but instead returns a promise that resolves with a Response object.

The Response object, in turn, does not directly contain the actual JSON response body but is instead a representation of the entire HTTP response. So, to extract the JSON body content from the Response object, we use the json() method, which returns a second promise that resolves with the result of parsing the response body text as JSON.

We will add this line-
```javascript
const data = await response.json()
console.log(data)
```

We will receive the data in JS object format.

Now we will **extract dynamic values from** the object. 

Look into the format, to obtain temperature, we will go under `current` and then in `temp_c`

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/049/301/original/upload_894097c9f4d2225e2a1f65d7e0100f5b.png?1695149343)

Let us write the required values. 

```java
let currentTemp = data.current.temp_c
let currentCondition = data.current.condition.text
let locationName = data.location.name
let localTime = data.location.localtime
let conditionEmoji = data.current.condition.icon
```
We will print these values on the console to see if they have been fetched properly or not. Output is

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/049/302/original/upload_a8add666735fe1907f2e69614eac16b5.png?1695149375)


To print and display the data on the website, we will use DOM. The data has to be changed dynamically and for that, DOM has to be used. We will use the classes earlier written in HTML to target and dynamically set values. The code for DOM part-

```javascript
const temperatureField = document.querySelector(".temp");
const cityField = document.querySelector(".time_location p");
const dateField = document.querySelector(".time_location span");
const emojiField = document.querySelector(".weather_condition img");
const weatherField = document.querySelector(".weather_condition span");
const searchField = document.querySelector(".searchField");
const form = document.querySelector("form");
```
> Just explain in short about the variable and which class it is targeting. Eg- `temperatureField` variable is targeting the `temp` class. 

Now, we want to make our search bar work. We will add an event listener to it. Whenever there is an event performed, the event listener will execute the callback function passed as a parameter. 

The search function changes the value of the target(the target city) to the value that we have entered. After typing the city and pressing the submit button, the form will get submitted and the "submit" event will get invoked. 

The `fetchData` function will be passed the value of the target that we have entered. 

```javascript
form.addEventListener('submit' , search )

//search- callback function

function search(){
    target = searchField.value

    fetchData(target)
}

```

The code till now is

```javascript
const temperatureField = document.querySelector(".temp");
const cityField = document.querySelector(".time_location p");
const dateField = document.querySelector(".time_location span");
const emojiField = document.querySelector(".weather_condition img");
const weatherField = document.querySelector(".weather_condition span");
const searchField = document.querySelector(".searchField");
const form = document.querySelector("form");

let target = "Pune"
async function fetchData(target){
    try {
        let url = `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=8b6d5f63a04a485fa5351525232908&q=${target}&aqi=no`

        const response = await fetch(url)

        const data = await response.json()

        form.addEventListener('submit' , search )

        function search(){
            target = searchField.value
        
            fetchData(target)
        }
        console.log(data)

        let currentTemp = data.current.temp_c
        let currentCondition = data.current.condition.text
        let locationName = data.location.name
        let localTime = data.location.localtime
        let conditionEmoji = data.current.condition.icon
        console.log(currentTemp ,currentCondition ,locationName , localTime , conditionEmoji )
    }
    catch(error){
        console.log(error)
    }
}
fetchData(target)
```

After we run the code, we see that even after entering the name of the city in the search bar, the results are not getting updated. It is because, the form is submitting the value somewhere and page is getting refreshed. This is the nature of the form that after it is submitted, the page is refreshed. 

For that, we use the **preventDefault()** method. Our code for the `search()` function becomes-

```javascript
function search(e){

    e.preventDefault()
    target = searchField.value

    fetchData(target)
}
```

Now, when we search for a city, the output is obtained on the console.

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/049/303/original/upload_07b20aa1d296c7ce114e051640ac2a33.png?1695149418)


Now, we will update the data on our page. A function `updateDOM()` will be created which will contain the values to be updates as parameters.


>First demonstrate this example. We will use the **innerText()** method to set the value inside the HTML.

```javascript
function updateDOM(temp , locationName , time , emoji , condition){

    temperatureField.innerText = temp

    cityField.innerText = locationName

    
    emojiField.src = emoji

    weatherField.innerText = condition
}
```

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/049/304/original/upload_3086c0907f207f7aecf7c97855c347e4.png?1695149448)


**ADD DAY**

We can also add day along with the date. Here, **date objects** will be used. 


Since the date and time is separated by a space, we will use the **split()** method to separate them. 

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/049/305/original/upload_1ca3475c0f4e577805e4d08339373c48.png?1695149470)

The split() method splits the value at the delimiter provided and returns an array. Here. after splitting the above value, we get the date at 0th position and time at 1st position. 

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/049/306/original/upload_6dcd1d672b2d81019b045800199a9104.png?1695149492)

```javascript
const exactTime = time.split(" ")[1]
const exactdate = time.split(' ')[0]
```

To convert date to day, we follow-
```java
const exactDate = new Date(exactdate).getDay()
```

The output is a number which indicate the day in form of a number. 

![](https://d2beiqkhq929f0.cloudfront.net/public_assets/assets/000/049/307/original/upload_7cbfda536fac2d05ec6f13b7ac54321f.png?1695149519)

We will write another function that converts the day number to day. 

```javascript
function getDayFullName(num) {
    switch (num) {
      case 0:
        return "Sunday";

      case 1:
        return "Monday";

      case 2:
        return "Tuesday";

      case 3:
        return "Wednesday";

      case 4:
        return "Thursday";

      case 5:
        return "Friday";

      case 6:
        return "Saturday";

      default:
        return "Don't Know";
    }
  }
```

Our final code is 

```javascript
const temperatureField = document.querySelector(".temp");
const cityField = document.querySelector(".time_location p");
const dateField = document.querySelector(".time_location span");
const emojiField = document.querySelector(".weather_condition img");
const weatherField = document.querySelector(".weather_condition span");
const searchField = document.querySelector(".searchField");
const form = document.querySelector("form");


let target = 'Pune'


form.addEventListener('submit' , search )


function search(e){

    e.preventDefault()
    target = searchField.value

    fetchData(target)
}



async function fetchData(target){
    try {
        let url = `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=35af7ff606db422880d141328231305&q=${target}&aqi=no`

        const response = await fetch(url)

        const data = await response.json()

        console.log(data)


        let currentTemp = data.current.temp_c
        let currentCondition = data.current.condition.text
        let locationName = data.location.name
        let localTime = data.location.localtime
        let conditionEmoji = data.current.condition.icon

        console.log(currentTemp ,currentCondition ,locationName , localTime , conditionEmoji )


       updateDOM(currentTemp , locationName ,localTime ,conditionEmoji , currentCondition)

    } catch (error) {
        console.log(error)

    emojiField.src = emoji

    weatherField.innerText = condition


}

    switch (num) {
      case 0:
